As a result, he has relentlessly focused on practical applications in his research, work that has netted him the 2022 Reactor Technology Award from the American Nuclear Society. \\u201cThe award has usually recognized practical contributions to the field of reactor design and has not often gone to academia,\\u201d Shirvan says.', 'One of these \\u201cpractical contributions\\u201d is in the field of accident-tolerant fuels, a program launched by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi incident. The goal within this program, says Shirvan, is to develop new forms of nuclear fuels that can tolerate heat. His team, with students from over 16 countries, is working on numerous possibilities that range in composition and method of production.', 'Another aspect of Shirvan\\u2019s research focuses on how radiation impacts heat transfer mechanisms in the reactor. The team found fuel corrosion to be the driving force. \\u201c[The research] informs how nuclear fuels perform in the reactor, from a practical point of view,\\u201d Shirvan says.', 'Optimizing nuclear reactor design', 'A summer internship when Shirvan was an undergraduate at the University of Florida at Gainesville seeded his drive to focus on practical applications in his studies. A nearby nuclear utility was losing millions because of crud accumulating on fuel rods. Over time, the company was solving the problem by using more fuel, before it had extracted all the life from earlier batches.', 'Placement of fuel rods in nuclear reactors is a complex problem with many factors \\u2014 the life of the fuel, location of hot spots \\u2014 affecting outcomes. Nuclear reactors change their configuration of fuel rods every 18-24 months to optimize close to 15-20 constraints, leading to roughly 200-800 assemblies. The mind-boggling nature of the problem means that plants have to rely on experienced engineers.', 'During his internship, Shirvan optimized the program used to place fuel rods in the reactor. He found that certain rods in assemblies were more prone to the crud deposits, and reworked their configurations, optimizing for these rods\\u2019 performance instead of adding assemblies.', 'In recent years, Shirvan has applied a branch of artificial intelligence \\u2014 reinforcement learning \\u2014 to the configuration problem and created a software program used by the largest U.S. nuclear utility. \\u201cThis program gives even a layperson the ability to reconfigure the fuels and the reactor without having expert knowledge,\\u201d Shirvan says.', 'From advanced math to counting jelly beans', 'Shirvan\\u2019s own expertise in nuclear science and engineering developed quite organically. He grew up in Tehran, Iran, and when he was 14 the family moved to Gainesville, where Shirvan\\u2019s aunt and family live. He remembers an awkward couple of years at the new high school where he was grouped in with newly arrived international students, and placed in entry-level classes. \\u201cI went from doing advanced mathematics in Iran to counting jelly beans,\\u201d he laughs.', 'Shirvan applied to the University of Florida for his undergraduate studies since it made economic sense; the school gave full scholarships to Floridian students who received a certain minimum SAT score. Shirvan qualified. His uncle, who was a professor in the nuclear engineering department then, encouraged Shirvan to take classes in the department. Under his uncle\\u2019s mentorship, the courses Shirvan took, and his internship, cemented his love of the interdisciplinary approach that the field demanded.', \\\"Having always known that he wanted to teach \\u2014 he remembers finishing his math tests early in Tehran so he could earn the reward of being class monitor \\u2014 Shirvan knew graduate school was next. His uncle encouraged him to apply to MIT and to the University of Michigan, home to reputable programs in the field. Shirvan chose MIT because \\u201conly at MIT was there a program on nuclear design. There were faculty dedicated to designing new reactors, looking at multiple disciplines, and putting all of that together.\\u201d He went on to pursue his master's and doctoral studies at NSE under the supervision of Professor Mujid Kazimi, focusing on compact pressurized and boiling water reactor designs. When Kazimi passed away suddenly in 2015, Shirvan was a research scientist, and switched to tenure track to guide the professor\\u2019s team.\\\", 'Another project that Shirvan took in 2015: leadership of MIT\\u2019s course on nuclear reactor technology for utility executives. Offered only by the Institute, the program is an introduction to nuclear engineering and safety for personnel who might not have much background in the area. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a great course because you get to see what the real problems are in the energy sector \\u2026 like grid stability,\\u201d Shirvan says.', 'A multipronged approach to savings', 'Another very real problem nuclear utilities face is cost. Contrary to what one hears on the news, one of the biggest stumbling blocks to building new nuclear facilities in the United States is cost, which today can be up to three times that of renewables, Shirvan says. While many approaches such as advanced manufacturing have been tried, Shirvan believes that the solution to decrease expenditures lies in designing more compact reactors.', 'His team has developed an open-source advanced nuclear cost tool and has focused on two different designs: a small water reactor using compact steam technology and a horizontal gas reactor. Compactness also means making fuels more efficient, as Shirvan\\u2019s work does, and in improving the heat exchange device. It\\u2019s all back to the basics and bringing \\u201ccommercial viable arguments in with your research,\\u201d Shirvan explains.', 'Shirvan is excited about the future of the U.S. nuclear industry, and that the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act grants the same subsidies to nuclear as it does for renewables. In this new level playing field, advanced nuclear still has a long way to go in terms of affordability, he admits. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to push forward with cost-effective design,\\u201d Shirvan says, \\u201cI look forward to supporting this by continuing to guide these efforts with research from my team.\\u201d']\",\n          \"['\\u201cMIT is a place where dreams come true,\\u201d says C\\u00e9sar Terrer, an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Here at MIT, Terrer says he\\u2019s given the resources needed to explore ideas he finds most exciting, and at the top of his list is climate science. In particular, he is interested in plant-soil interactions, and how the two can mitigate impacts of climate change. In 2022, Terrer received seed grant funding from the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) to produce drought monitoring systems for farmers. The project is leveraging a new generation of remote sensing devices to provide high-resolution plant water stress at regional to global scales.', 'Growing up in Granada, Spain, Terrer always had an aptitude and passion for science. He studied environmental science at the University of Murcia, where he interned in the Department of Ecology. Using computational analysis tools, he worked on modeling species distribution in response to human development. Early on in his undergraduate experience, Terrer says he regarded his professors as \\u201csuperheroes\\u201d with a kind of scholarly prowess. He knew he wanted to follow in their footsteps by one day working as a faculty member in academia. Of course, there would be many steps along the way before achieving that dream.', 'Upon completing his undergraduate studies, Terrer set his sights on exciting and adventurous research roles. He thought perhaps he would conduct field work in the Amazon, engaging with native communities. But when the opportunity arose to work in Australia on a state-of-the-art climate change experiment that simulates future levels of carbon dioxide, he headed south to study how plants react to CO2 in a biome of native Australian eucalyptus trees. It was during this experience that Terrer started to take a keen interest in the carbon cycle and the capacity of ecosystems to buffer rising levels of CO2 caused by human activity.', 'Around 2014, he began to delve deeper into the carbon cycle as he began his doctoral studies at Imperial College London. The primary question Terrer sought to answer during his PhD was \\u201cwill plants be able to absorb predicted future levels of CO2 in the atmosphere?\\u201d To answer the question, Terrer became an early adopter of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and remote sensing to analyze data from real-life, global climate change experiments. His findings from these \\u201cground truth\\u201d values and observations resulted in a paper in the journal Science. In it, he claimed that climate models most likely overestimated how much carbon plants will be able to absorb by the end of the century, by a factor of three.', 'After postdoctoral positions at Stanford University and the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, followed by a prestigious Lawrence Fellowship, Terrer says he had \\u201ctoo many ideas and not enough time to accomplish all those ideas.\\u201d He knew it was time to lead his own group. Not long after applying for faculty positions, he landed at MIT.', 'New ways to monitor drought', 'Terrer is employing similar methods to those he used during his PhD to analyze data from all over the world for his J-WAFS project. He and postdoc Wenzhe Jiao collect data from remote sensing satellites and field experiments and use machine learning to come up with new ways to monitor drought. Terrer says Jiao is a \\u201cremote sensing wizard,\\u201d who fuses data from different satellite products to understand the water cycle. With Jiao\\u2019s hydrology expertise and Terrer\\u2019s knowledge of plants, soil, and the carbon cycle, the duo is a formidable team to tackle this project.', 'According to the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, the number and duration of droughts has increased by 29 percent since 2000, as compared to the two previous decades. From the Horn of Africa to the Western United States, drought is devastating vegetation and severely stressing water supplies, compromising food production and spiking food insecurity. Drought monitoring can offer fundamental information on drought location, frequency, and severity, but assessing the impact of drought on vegetation is extremely challenging. This is because plants\\u2019 sensitivity to water deficits varies across species and ecosystems.', 'Terrer and Jiao are able to obtain a clearer picture of how drought is affecting plants by employing the latest generation of remote sensing observations, which offer images of the planet with incredible spatial and temporal resolution. Satellite products such as Sentinel, Landsat, and Planet can provide daily images from space with such high resolution that individual trees can be discerned. Along with the images and datasets from satellites, the team is using ground-based observations from meteorological data. They are also using the MIT SuperCloud at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to process and analyze all of the data sets. The J-WAFS project is among one of the first to leverage high-resolution data to quantitatively measure plant drought impacts in the United States with the hopes of expanding to a global assessment in the future.', 'Assisting farmers and resource managers', 'Every week, the U.S. Drought Monitor provides a map of drought conditions in the United States. The map has zero resolution and is more of a drought recap or summary, unable to predict future drought scenarios. The lack of a comprehensive spatiotemporal evaluation of historic and future drought impacts on global vegetation productivity is detrimental to farmers both in the United States and worldwide.', 'Terrer and Jiao plan to generate metrics for plant water stress at an unprecedented resolution of 10-30 meters. This means that they will be able to provide drought monitoring maps at the scale of a typical U.S. farm, giving farmers more precise, useful data every one to two days. The team will use the information from the satellites to monitor plant growth and soil moisture, as well as the time lag of plant growth response to soil moisture. In this way, Terrer and Jiao say they will eventually be able to create a kind of \\u201cplant water stress forecast\\u201d that may be able to predict adverse impacts of drought four weeks in advance. \\u201cAccording to the current soil moisture and lagged response time, we hope to predict plant water stress in the future,\\u201d says Jiao.', 'The expected outcomes of this project will give farmers, land and water resource managers, and decision-makers more accurate data at the farm-specific level, allowing for better drought preparation, mitigation, and adaptation. \\u201cWe expect to make our data open-access online, after we finish the project, so that farmers and other stakeholders can use the maps as tools,\\u201d says Jiao.', 'Terrer adds that the project \\u201chas the potential to help us better understand the future states of climate systems, and also identify the regional hot spots more likely to experience water crises at the national, state, local, and tribal government scales.\\u201d He also expects the project will enhance our understanding of global carbon-water-energy cycle responses to drought, with applications in determining climate change impacts on natural ecosystems as a whole.']\",\n          \"['In science and technology, there has been a long and steady drive toward improving the accuracy of measurements of all kinds, along with parallel efforts to enhance the resolution of images. An accompanying goal is to reduce the uncertainty in the estimates that can be made, and the inferences drawn, from the data (visual or otherwise) that have been collected. Yet uncertainty can never be wholly eliminated. And since we have to live with it, at least to some extent, there is much to be gained by quantifying the uncertainty as precisely as possible.', 'Expressed in other terms, we\\u2019d like to know just how uncertain our uncertainty is.', 'That issue was taken up in a new study, led by Swami Sankaranarayanan, a postdoc at MIT\\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and his co-authors \\u2014 Anastasios Angelopoulos and Stephen Bates of the University of California at Berkeley; Yaniv Romano of Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology; and Phillip Isola, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. These researchers succeeded not only in obtaining accurate measures of uncertainty, they also found a way to display uncertainty in a manner the average person could grasp.', 'Their paper, which was presented in December at the Neural Information Processing Systems Conference in New Orleans, relates to computer vision \\u2014 a field of artificial intelligence that involves training computers to glean information from digital images. The focus of this research is on images that are partially smudged or corrupted (due to missing pixels), as well as on methods \\u2014 computer algorithms, in particular \\u2014 that are designed to uncover the part of the signal that is marred or otherwise concealed. An algorithm of this sort, Sankaranarayanan explains, \\u201ctakes the blurred image as the input and gives you a clean image as the output\\u201d \\u2014 a process that typically occurs in a couple of steps.', 'First, there is an encoder, a kind of neural network specifically trained by the researchers for the task of de-blurring fuzzy images. The encoder takes a distorted image and, from that, creates an abstract (or \\u201clatent\\u201d) representation of a clean image in a form \\u2014 consisting of a list of numbers \\u2014 that is intelligible to a computer but would not make sense to most humans. The next step is a decoder, of which there are a couple of types, that are again usually neural networks. Sankaranarayanan and his colleagues worked with a kind of decoder called a \\u201cgenerative\\u201d model. In particular, they used an off-the-shelf version called StyleGAN, which takes the numbers from the encoded representation (of a cat, for instance) as its input and then constructs a complete, cleaned-up image (of that particular cat). So the entire process, including the encoding and decoding stages, yields a crisp picture from an originally muddied rendering.', 'But how much faith can someone place in the accuracy of the resultant image? And, as addressed in the December 2022 paper, what is the best way to represent the uncertainty in that image? The standard approach is to create a \\u201csaliency map,\\u201d which ascribes a probability value \\u2014 somewhere between 0 and 1 \\u2014 to indicate the confidence the model has in the correctness of every pixel, taken one at a time. This strategy has a drawback, according to Sankaranarayanan, \\u201cbecause the prediction is performed independently for each pixel. But meaningful objects occur within groups of pixels, not within an individual pixel,\\u201d he adds, which is why he and his colleagues are proposing an entirely different way of assessing uncertainty.', 'Their approach is centered around the \\u201csemantic attributes\\u201d of an image \\u2014 groups of pixels that, when taken together, have meaning, making up a human face, for example, or a dog, or some other recognizable thing. The objective, Sankaranarayanan maintains, \\u201cis to estimate uncertainty in a way that relates to the groupings of pixels that humans can readily interpret.\\u201d', 'Whereas the standard method might yield a single image, constituting the \\u201cbest guess\\u201d as to what the true picture should be, the uncertainty in that representation is normally hard to discern. The new paper argues that for use in the real world, uncertainty should be presented in a way that holds meaning for people who are not experts in machine learning. Rather than producing a single image, the authors have devised a procedure for generating a range of images \\u2014 each of which might be correct. Moreover, they can set precise bounds on the range, or interval, and provide a probabilistic guarantee that the true depiction lies somewhere within that range. A narrower range can be provided if the user is comfortable with, say, 90 percent certitude, and a narrower range still if more risk is acceptable.', 'The authors believe their paper puts forth the first algorithm, designed for a generative model, which can establish uncertainty intervals that relate to meaningful (semantically-interpretable) features of an image and come with \\u201ca formal statistical guarantee.\\u201d While that is an important milestone, Sankaranarayanan considers it merely a step toward \\u201cthe ultimate goal. So far, we have been able to do this for simple things, like restoring images of human faces or animals, but we want to extend this approach into more critical domains, such as medical imaging, where our \\u2018statistical guarantee\\u2019 could be especially important.\\u201d', 'Suppose that the film, or radiograph, of a chest X-ray is blurred, he adds, \\u201cand you want to reconstruct the image. If you are given a range of images, you want to know that the true image is contained within that range, so you are not missing anything critical\\u201d \\u2014 information that might reveal whether or not a patient has lung cancer or pneumonia. In fact, Sankaranarayanan and his colleagues have already begun working with a radiologist to see if their algorithm for predicting pneumonia could be useful in a clinical setting.', 'Their work may also have relevance in the law enforcement field, he says. \\u201cThe picture from a surveillance camera may be blurry, and you want to enhance that. Models for doing that already exist, but it is not easy to gauge the uncertainty. And you don\\u2019t want to make a mistake in a life-or-death situation.\\u201d The tools that he and his colleagues are developing could help identify a guilty person and help exonerate an innocent one as well.', 'Much of what we do and many of the things happening in the world around us are shrouded in uncertainty, Sankaranarayanan notes. Therefore, gaining a firmer grasp of that uncertainty could help us in countless ways. For one thing, it can tell us more about exactly what it is we do not know.', \\\"Angelopoulos was supported by the National Science Foundation.

As a result, he has relentlessly focused on practical applications in his research, work that has netted him the 2022 Reactor Technology Award from the American Nuclear Society. \\u201cThe award has usually recognized practical contributions to the field of reactor design and has not often gone to academia,\\u201d Shirvan says.', 'One of these \\u201cpractical contributions\\u201d is in the field of accident-tolerant fuels, a program launched by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi incident. The goal within this program, says Shirvan, is to develop new forms of nuclear fuels that can tolerate heat. His team, with students from over 16 countries, is working on numerous possibilities that range in composition and method of production.', 'Another aspect of Shirvan\\u2019s research focuses on how radiation impacts heat transfer mechanisms in the reactor. The team found fuel corrosion to be the driving force. \\u201c[The research] informs how nuclear fuels perform in the reactor, from a practical point of view,\\u201d Shirvan says.', 'Optimizing nuclear reactor design', 'A summer internship when Shirvan was an undergraduate at the University of Florida at Gainesville seeded his drive to focus on practical applications in his studies. A nearby nuclear utility was losing millions because of crud accumulating on fuel rods. Over time, the company was solving the problem by using more fuel, before it had extracted all the life from earlier batches.', 'Placement of fuel rods in nuclear reactors is a complex problem with many factors \\u2014 the life of the fuel, location of hot spots \\u2014 affecting outcomes. Nuclear reactors change their configuration of fuel rods every 18-24 months to optimize close to 15-20 constraints, leading to roughly 200-800 assemblies. The mind-boggling nature of the problem means that plants have to rely on experienced engineers.', 'During his internship, Shirvan optimized the program used to place fuel rods in the reactor. He found that certain rods in assemblies were more prone to the crud deposits, and reworked their configurations, optimizing for these rods\\u2019 performance instead of adding assemblies.', 'In recent years, Shirvan has applied a branch of artificial intelligence \\u2014 reinforcement learning \\u2014 to the configuration problem and created a software program used by the largest U.S. nuclear utility. \\u201cThis program gives even a layperson the ability to reconfigure the fuels and the reactor without having expert knowledge,\\u201d Shirvan says.', 'From advanced math to counting jelly beans', 'Shirvan\\u2019s own expertise in nuclear science and engineering developed quite organically. He grew up in Tehran, Iran, and when he was 14 the family moved to Gainesville, where Shirvan\\u2019s aunt and family live. He remembers an awkward couple of years at the new high school where he was grouped in with newly arrived international students, and placed in entry-level classes. \\u201cI went from doing advanced mathematics in Iran to counting jelly beans,\\u201d he laughs.', 'Shirvan applied to the University of Florida for his undergraduate studies since it made economic sense; the school gave full scholarships to Floridian students who received a certain minimum SAT score. Shirvan qualified. His uncle, who was a professor in the nuclear engineering department then, encouraged Shirvan to take classes in the department. Under his uncle\\u2019s mentorship, the courses Shirvan took, and his internship, cemented his love of the interdisciplinary approach that the field demanded.', \\\"Having always known that he wanted to teach \\u2014 he remembers finishing his math tests early in Tehran so he could earn the reward of being class monitor \\u2014 Shirvan knew graduate school was next. His uncle encouraged him to apply to MIT and to the University of Michigan, home to reputable programs in the field. Shirvan chose MIT because \\u201conly at MIT was there a program on nuclear design. There were faculty dedicated to designing new reactors, looking at multiple disciplines, and putting all of that together.\\u201d He went on to pursue his master's and doctoral studies at NSE under the supervision of Professor Mujid Kazimi, focusing on compact pressurized and boiling water reactor designs. When Kazimi passed away suddenly in 2015, Shirvan was a research scientist, and switched to tenure track to guide the professor\\u2019s team.\\\", 'Another project that Shirvan took in 2015: leadership of MIT\\u2019s course on nuclear reactor technology for utility executives. Offered only by the Institute, the program is an introduction to nuclear engineering and safety for personnel who might not have much background in the area. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a great course because you get to see what the real problems are in the energy sector \\u2026 like grid stability,\\u201d Shirvan says.', 'A multipronged approach to savings', 'Another very real problem nuclear utilities face is cost. Contrary to what one hears on the news, one of the biggest stumbling blocks to building new nuclear facilities in the United States is cost, which today can be up to three times that of renewables, Shirvan says. While many approaches such as advanced manufacturing have been tried, Shirvan believes that the solution to decrease expenditures lies in designing more compact reactors.', 'His team has developed an open-source advanced nuclear cost tool and has focused on two different designs: a small water reactor using compact steam technology and a horizontal gas reactor. Compactness also means making fuels more efficient, as Shirvan\\u2019s work does, and in improving the heat exchange device. It\\u2019s all back to the basics and bringing \\u201ccommercial viable arguments in with your research,\\u201d Shirvan explains.', 'Shirvan is excited about the future of the U.S. nuclear industry, and that the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act grants the same subsidies to nuclear as it does for renewables. In this new level playing field, advanced nuclear still has a long way to go in terms of affordability, he admits. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to push forward with cost-effective design,\\u201d Shirvan says, \\u201cI look forward to supporting this by continuing to guide these efforts with research from my team.\\u201d']\",\n          \"['\\u201cMIT is a place where dreams come true,\\u201d says C\\u00e9sar Terrer, an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Here at MIT, Terrer says he\\u2019s given the resources needed to explore ideas he finds most exciting, and at the top of his list is climate science. In particular, he is interested in plant-soil interactions, and how the two can mitigate impacts of climate change. In 2022, Terrer received seed grant funding from the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) to produce drought monitoring systems for farmers. The project is leveraging a new generation of remote sensing devices to provide high-resolution plant water stress at regional to global scales.', 'Growing up in Granada, Spain, Terrer always had an aptitude and passion for science. He studied environmental science at the University of Murcia, where he interned in the Department of Ecology. Using computational analysis tools, he worked on modeling species distribution in response to human development. Early on in his undergraduate experience, Terrer says he regarded his professors as \\u201csuperheroes\\u201d with a kind of scholarly prowess. He knew he wanted to follow in their footsteps by one day working as a faculty member in academia. Of course, there would be many steps along the way before achieving that dream.', 'Upon completing his undergraduate studies, Terrer set his sights on exciting and adventurous research roles. He thought perhaps he would conduct field work in the Amazon, engaging with native communities. But when the opportunity arose to work in Australia on a state-of-the-art climate change experiment that simulates future levels of carbon dioxide, he headed south to study how plants react to CO2 in a biome of native Australian eucalyptus trees. It was during this experience that Terrer started to take a keen interest in the carbon cycle and the capacity of ecosystems to buffer rising levels of CO2 caused by human activity.', 'Around 2014, he began to delve deeper into the carbon cycle as he began his doctoral studies at Imperial College London. The primary question Terrer sought to answer during his PhD was \\u201cwill plants be able to absorb predicted future levels of CO2 in the atmosphere?\\u201d To answer the question, Terrer became an early adopter of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and remote sensing to analyze data from real-life, global climate change experiments. His findings from these \\u201cground truth\\u201d values and observations resulted in a paper in the journal Science. In it, he claimed that climate models most likely overestimated how much carbon plants will be able to absorb by the end of the century, by a factor of three.', 'After postdoctoral positions at Stanford University and the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, followed by a prestigious Lawrence Fellowship, Terrer says he had \\u201ctoo many ideas and not enough time to accomplish all those ideas.\\u201d He knew it was time to lead his own group. Not long after applying for faculty positions, he landed at MIT.', 'New ways to monitor drought', 'Terrer is employing similar methods to those he used during his PhD to analyze data from all over the world for his J-WAFS project. He and postdoc Wenzhe Jiao collect data from remote sensing satellites and field experiments and use machine learning to come up with new ways to monitor drought. Terrer says Jiao is a \\u201cremote sensing wizard,\\u201d who fuses data from different satellite products to understand the water cycle. With Jiao\\u2019s hydrology expertise and Terrer\\u2019s knowledge of plants, soil, and the carbon cycle, the duo is a formidable team to tackle this project.', 'According to the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, the number and duration of droughts has increased by 29 percent since 2000, as compared to the two previous decades. From the Horn of Africa to the Western United States, drought is devastating vegetation and severely stressing water supplies, compromising food production and spiking food insecurity. Drought monitoring can offer fundamental information on drought location, frequency, and severity, but assessing the impact of drought on vegetation is extremely challenging. This is because plants\\u2019 sensitivity to water deficits varies across species and ecosystems.', 'Terrer and Jiao are able to obtain a clearer picture of how drought is affecting plants by employing the latest generation of remote sensing observations, which offer images of the planet with incredible spatial and temporal resolution. Satellite products such as Sentinel, Landsat, and Planet can provide daily images from space with such high resolution that individual trees can be discerned. Along with the images and datasets from satellites, the team is using ground-based observations from meteorological data. They are also using the MIT SuperCloud at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to process and analyze all of the data sets. The J-WAFS project is among one of the first to leverage high-resolution data to quantitatively measure plant drought impacts in the United States with the hopes of expanding to a global assessment in the future.', 'Assisting farmers and resource managers', 'Every week, the U.S. Drought Monitor provides a map of drought conditions in the United States. The map has zero resolution and is more of a drought recap or summary, unable to predict future drought scenarios. The lack of a comprehensive spatiotemporal evaluation of historic and future drought impacts on global vegetation productivity is detrimental to farmers both in the United States and worldwide.', 'Terrer and Jiao plan to generate metrics for plant water stress at an unprecedented resolution of 10-30 meters. This means that they will be able to provide drought monitoring maps at the scale of a typical U.S. farm, giving farmers more precise, useful data every one to two days. The team will use the information from the satellites to monitor plant growth and soil moisture, as well as the time lag of plant growth response to soil moisture. In this way, Terrer and Jiao say they will eventually be able to create a kind of \\u201cplant water stress forecast\\u201d that may be able to predict adverse impacts of drought four weeks in advance. \\u201cAccording to the current soil moisture and lagged response time, we hope to predict plant water stress in the future,\\u201d says Jiao.', 'The expected outcomes of this project will give farmers, land and water resource managers, and decision-makers more accurate data at the farm-specific level, allowing for better drought preparation, mitigation, and adaptation. \\u201cWe expect to make our data open-access online, after we finish the project, so that farmers and other stakeholders can use the maps as tools,\\u201d says Jiao.', 'Terrer adds that the project \\u201chas the potential to help us better understand the future states of climate systems, and also identify the regional hot spots more likely to experience water crises at the national, state, local, and tribal government scales.\\u201d He also expects the project will enhance our understanding of global carbon-water-energy cycle responses to drought, with applications in determining climate change impacts on natural ecosystems as a whole.']\",\n          \"['In science and technology, there has been a long and steady drive toward improving the accuracy of measurements of all kinds, along with parallel efforts to enhance the resolution of images. An accompanying goal is to reduce the uncertainty in the estimates that can be made, and the inferences drawn, from the data (visual or otherwise) that have been collected. Yet uncertainty can never be wholly eliminated. And since we have to live with it, at least to some extent, there is much to be gained by quantifying the uncertainty as precisely as possible.', 'Expressed in other terms, we\\u2019d like to know just how uncertain our uncertainty is.', 'That issue was taken up in a new study, led by Swami Sankaranarayanan, a postdoc at MIT\\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and his co-authors \\u2014 Anastasios Angelopoulos and Stephen Bates of the University of California at Berkeley; Yaniv Romano of Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology; and Phillip Isola, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. These researchers succeeded not only in obtaining accurate measures of uncertainty, they also found a way to display uncertainty in a manner the average person could grasp.', 'Their paper, which was presented in December at the Neural Information Processing Systems Conference in New Orleans, relates to computer vision \\u2014 a field of artificial intelligence that involves training computers to glean information from digital images. The focus of this research is on images that are partially smudged or corrupted (due to missing pixels), as well as on methods \\u2014 computer algorithms, in particular \\u2014 that are designed to uncover the part of the signal that is marred or otherwise concealed. An algorithm of this sort, Sankaranarayanan explains, \\u201ctakes the blurred image as the input and gives you a clean image as the output\\u201d \\u2014 a process that typically occurs in a couple of steps.', 'First, there is an encoder, a kind of neural network specifically trained by the researchers for the task of de-blurring fuzzy images. The encoder takes a distorted image and, from that, creates an abstract (or \\u201clatent\\u201d) representation of a clean image in a form \\u2014 consisting of a list of numbers \\u2014 that is intelligible to a computer but would not make sense to most humans. The next step is a decoder, of which there are a couple of types, that are again usually neural networks. Sankaranarayanan and his colleagues worked with a kind of decoder called a \\u201cgenerative\\u201d model. In particular, they used an off-the-shelf version called StyleGAN, which takes the numbers from the encoded representation (of a cat, for instance) as its input and then constructs a complete, cleaned-up image (of that particular cat). So the entire process, including the encoding and decoding stages, yields a crisp picture from an originally muddied rendering.', 'But how much faith can someone place in the accuracy of the resultant image? And, as addressed in the December 2022 paper, what is the best way to represent the uncertainty in that image? The standard approach is to create a \\u201csaliency map,\\u201d which ascribes a probability value \\u2014 somewhere between 0 and 1 \\u2014 to indicate the confidence the model has in the correctness of every pixel, taken one at a time. This strategy has a drawback, according to Sankaranarayanan, \\u201cbecause the prediction is performed independently for each pixel. But meaningful objects occur within groups of pixels, not within an individual pixel,\\u201d he adds, which is why he and his colleagues are proposing an entirely different way of assessing uncertainty.', 'Their approach is centered around the \\u201csemantic attributes\\u201d of an image \\u2014 groups of pixels that, when taken together, have meaning, making up a human face, for example, or a dog, or some other recognizable thing. The objective, Sankaranarayanan maintains, \\u201cis to estimate uncertainty in a way that relates to the groupings of pixels that humans can readily interpret.\\u201d', 'Whereas the standard method might yield a single image, constituting the \\u201cbest guess\\u201d as to what the true picture should be, the uncertainty in that representation is normally hard to discern. The new paper argues that for use in the real world, uncertainty should be presented in a way that holds meaning for people who are not experts in machine learning. Rather than producing a single image, the authors have devised a procedure for generating a range of images \\u2014 each of which might be correct. Moreover, they can set precise bounds on the range, or interval, and provide a probabilistic guarantee that the true depiction lies somewhere within that range. A narrower range can be provided if the user is comfortable with, say, 90 percent certitude, and a narrower range still if more risk is acceptable.', 'The authors believe their paper puts forth the first algorithm, designed for a generative model, which can establish uncertainty intervals that relate to meaningful (semantically-interpretable) features of an image and come with \\u201ca formal statistical guarantee.\\u201d While that is an important milestone, Sankaranarayanan considers it merely a step toward \\u201cthe ultimate goal. So far, we have been able to do this for simple things, like restoring images of human faces or animals, but we want to extend this approach into more critical domains, such as medical imaging, where our \\u2018statistical guarantee\\u2019 could be especially important.\\u201d', 'Suppose that the film, or radiograph, of a chest X-ray is blurred, he adds, \\u201cand you want to reconstruct the image. If you are given a range of images, you want to know that the true image is contained within that range, so you are not missing anything critical\\u201d \\u2014 information that might reveal whether or not a patient has lung cancer or pneumonia. In fact, Sankaranarayanan and his colleagues have already begun working with a radiologist to see if their algorithm for predicting pneumonia could be useful in a clinical setting.', 'Their work may also have relevance in the law enforcement field, he says. \\u201cThe picture from a surveillance camera may be blurry, and you want to enhance that. Models for doing that already exist, but it is not easy to gauge the uncertainty. And you don\\u2019t want to make a mistake in a life-or-death situation.\\u201d The tools that he and his colleagues are developing could help identify a guilty person and help exonerate an innocent one as well.', 'Much of what we do and many of the things happening in the world around us are shrouded in uncertainty, Sankaranarayanan notes. Therefore, gaining a firmer grasp of that uncertainty could help us in countless ways. For one thing, it can tell us more about exactly what it is we do not know.', \\\"Angelopoulos was supported by the National Science Foundation.

            "Document: [\"['Researchers from MIT and elsewhere have developed an interactive tool that, for the first time, lets users see and control how automated machine-learning systems work. The aim is to build confidence in these systems and find ways to improve them.', 'Designing a machine-learning model for a certain task — such as image classification, disease diagnoses, and stock market prediction — is an arduous, time-consuming process. Experts first choose from among many different algorithms to build the model around. Then, they manually tweak “hyperparameters” — which determine the model’s overall structure — before the model starts training.', 'Recently developed automated machine-learning (AutoML) systems iteratively test and modify algorithms and those hyperparameters, and select the best-suited models. But the systems operate as “black boxes,” meaning their selection techniques are hidden from users.

A lot of this AutoML work is still being conducted by academics, and the problem is that we often don’t do applied work. There is not a crystal-clear definition of what a domain expert is and in itself, “domain expert,” is a very nebulous phrase.
